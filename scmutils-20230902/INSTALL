Before installing scmutils, you must have already installed MIT/GNU
Scheme version 11.1 or later, and there must be a program
"mit-scheme" on your path that runs it.  Normally, "mit-scheme" is
found in "/usr/local/bin", but it may be somewhere else depending on
where it was installed.

To install scmutils, run the "install.sh" script in this directory.
It will run "mit-scheme" to find out where to put its binaries, and
then copy them there.

To uninstall scmutils, run the "uninstall.sh" script in this directory.

For convenience, copy the "mechanics.sh" script to somewhere on your
path; it will pass the right arguments to mit-scheme for using
scmutils.  You can rename this script if you like.
